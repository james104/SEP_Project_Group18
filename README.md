### Git Practice Guide
To do a development, should create a **feature branch** from **develop**. E.g. feature/abc
The develop and master branch are protected. You could not commit/push into them directly.
When you want to merge you feature branch into develop, you should create a pull request on GitHub and assign a reviewer to approve merging
